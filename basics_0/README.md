# OSI Model üåê

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is an abstract framework designed to describe layered communication and computer network design. It helps segregate the different parts that make communication possible. üì°

## Organization of the OSI Model üóÇÔ∏è

The OSI model is organized from the lowest level to the highest level:

- **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)**: Handles transmission on physical layers with electrical impulses, light, or radio signals.
- **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Manages application-specific communication like SNMP for emails, HTTP for web browsers, etc.

> **Note**: The OSI model is purely conceptual. It does not perform any functions in the networking process but serves as a framework to better understand complex interactions in communication systems. üí°

## Focus Areas for This Project üîç

In this project, we will mainly focus on:

- **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**: Especially TCP/UDP protocols.
- **Network Layer (Layer 3)**: Including IP and ICMP protocols.

The image below provides a concrete representation of how each layer relates to real-world applications. üñºÔ∏è
